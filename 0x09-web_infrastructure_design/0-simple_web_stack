THE ISSUES:
SPOF: This is the Single Point of Failure. The entire infrastructure operates on a solitary server. Consequently, should this server encounter an issue, the entire website will cease to function.

DOWNTIME: When it becomes necessary to assess the server's performance and perform maintenance, restarting the server becomes essential, leading to website downtime as a consequence.

When a single server experiences a surge in incoming traffic, it causes the website to crash. This occurs due to the limited capacity of the infrastructure to handle higher volumes of traffic.
