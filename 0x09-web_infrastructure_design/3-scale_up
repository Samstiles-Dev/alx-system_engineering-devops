One Server Addition:

Purpose: To expand the infrastructure's capacity and handle increased workload.
Explanation: The addition of a new server aims to alleviate the load on existing systems and prevent single-point failures by distributing tasks across multiple servers.

One Load-Balancer (HAProxy) Configured as a Cluster:

Purpose: To evenly distribute incoming traffic among the servers.
Explanation: HAProxy, configured as a cluster with multiple instances, enhances reliability by ensuring continuous availability and load distribution. This setup improves system performance and mitigates potential traffic overload on individual servers.

Component Splitting with Dedicated Servers (Web Server, Application Server, Database):

Purpose: To segregate and allocate specific tasks to dedicated servers, optimizing performance and security.
Explanation:
Web Server: Separating the web server enables the efficient handling of HTTP requests and the delivery of web content to users.
Application Server: Having a dedicated server for application processing ensures smoother execution of application-specific tasks, such as processing business logic and managing user interactions.
Database Server: Allocating a separate server for the database enhances data management, security, and scalability. It allows for more efficient handling of data storage, retrieval, and management.
By implementing these elements, the infrastructure aims to achieve:

- Enhanced performance and scalability by distributing tasks across multiple servers.
- Improved reliability and fault tolerance through load balancing and clustering mechanisms.
- Isolation and dedicated resources for specific functionalities, contributing to better resource utilization and security. When a single server encounters a sudden influx of traffic, the website crashes due to the infrastructure's restricted capacity to manage higher traffic volumes.
